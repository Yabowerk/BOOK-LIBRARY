# BOOK-LIBRARY
front-end for a Book Library which is a web app for students accessing department-specific books. It offers hard &amp; digital copies, providing flexible access to educational resources. I try to create a user-friendly interface using html, css, Bootstrap 3, and also incorporate icons for easy use.
